# TenTimesEnemyGeo

A Hollow Knight mod that makes enemies drop **10× more Geo** than normal.

Originally forked from **DisableEnemyGeo**, which removed Geo drops entirely.
This version instead boosts all enemy Geo values by a factor of 10.

## Changes from the original:
- Restores all enemy Geo drops
- Multiplies small, medium, and large Geo values by ×10
- Leaves Burster FSM behavior intact

## Requirements:
* SFCore
